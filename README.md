# bit.ly/whatsapp-update

Attackers might send such a link to your device and cause various problems. 
This is a Malicious code to drain your phone battery instead of WhatsApp update. *Strictly for educational purposes*
There is a scope to improvise this by adding service workers to run in the background while the user doesn't realise the battery is being used up.

Ways to stop if at all anyone tries to run the script.
1. Close the Browser Tab
Simply closing the tab or browser will terminate the script and stop the battery drain.

2. Kill the Browser Process
If the tab is frozen and unresponsive:

- On Android: Open recent apps and swipe away the browser.
- On PC: Open Task Manager (Windows: Ctrl + Shift + Esc, Mac: Cmd + Option + Esc) and force quit the browser.

Happy Hacking!!
